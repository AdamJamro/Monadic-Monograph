# Monadic-Monograph

Initially, this is meant to be a record of the Haskell course I enrolled in at Uni.

### Synopsis: Functional Programming and Category Theory

In this course, we explored the foundational concepts of functional programming and their connections to category theory. Key fundamentals:

- **Pure Functions**: Functions that always produce the same output for the same input and have no side effects.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as results.
- **Functors**: Mappings between categories that preserve the structure of categories, allowing us to apply functions within a context.
- **Monads**: A type of functor that allows for the chaining of operations while managing side effects, encapsulating values, and providing a context for computation.

The lecture emphasized the importance of these concepts in writing clean, maintainable, and expressive code in the functional paradigm.
